# Story_of_fish
final project based on android course of RS School


App will help fishermen keep a list of caught fish in their smartphone.
     The application implements the MVVM architecture. The application has a main screen that displays a list using Recycler Viev. The main screen acts as a UI controller. He receives the data he needs through the Model view.
      To add a new caught fish, the Activity DateForm is used, on which the user fills in the data about the fish and takes a photo. Working with the camera is processed in such a way that the user can change the photo after the preview. After adding a new fish, the user is taken to the main screen but can edit the fish object after clicking on the data. Also, the user can view the photo of the fish in full screen.
       The application implements sorting of fish according to various characteristics and changing the dark and light themes by clicking on the switch.
